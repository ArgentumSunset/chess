## Ruby Chess

Pretty self-explanatory, honestly. Just chess made in Ruby, with the Gosu Gem used for underlying rendering and drawing purposes.

Okay, if you haven't played chess before, here are the rules:

There are two teams, black and white, each with a king, a queen, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, and eight pawns.

# Moves

- Kings can move one space in any direction (but not diagonally). They are your most important pieces; don't put them at risk.
- Queens can move across the board both diagonally and vertically / horizontally. Queens are the most powerful pieces on the board.
- Rooks can move vertically and horizontally. They're also known as castles.
- Bishops can move diagonally in any direction.
- Knights move in an "L" shape, like one space up and two to the left, or two up and one to the right. Knights are the only pieces that can skip over other pieces; they don't have to stop behind a piece and wait.
- Pawns are kind of complicated. Usually, they can only move forward one space. If there is an opposing piece on the space forward and to the side, though (diagonally ahead one space) then they can take it. They can also move two spaces forward at the start of the game. Note: If a pawn reaches your opponent's end of the board (the row their king starts in) then they turn into another queen.
